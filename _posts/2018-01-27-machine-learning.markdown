## What is Machine Learning
There are tons of definitions for Machine Learning. From wikipedia, Machine Learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In practice, we use machine learning to solve two major kinds
of problems.

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data. There are also two subcategories.
- Linear regression problems
  - e.g: In farming, given data on crop yields over the last 50 years, learn to predict next year's crop yields.
- Classification problems
  - e.g: Try to predict it will rain tomorrow based on previous data.
2. Unsupervised Learning
e.g: Given sets of medical record data from patients. Try to categorize them into different groups.
