# The problem

        Internet has made people's life much more convenient than ever before. However, people's credentials as
    well as their personal information are at the risk of being stolen through web attackers.

    For Example:
    - While you are attempting to login to facebook, how do you know you are giving your password to the "real"
    facebook instead of a hacker's website. Their website can look exactly the same as facebook.com.
    - While you are making a purchase through Amazon.com, how do you make sure your credit card info is only
    visible to Amazon? Even If it's indeed Amazon.com, how do you make sure those info are not intercepted by
    some one in the middle?

    That's why today we are mostly using https instead of http.
